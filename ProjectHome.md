# Overview of Kojak #
Kojak is a free, open-source application for efficient identification of cross-linked peptides in a complex protein mixture. The algorithm can analyze data from samples cross-linked with virtually any stable cross-linker chemistry. Kojak can analyze both isotopically labeled and non-labeled data. The application accepts many open data formats (including mzXML and mzML) and produces a list of spectral identifications. Algorithm efficiency allows the use of large (even full) databases when searching. Kojak is available as compiled binaries for Windows and Linux, or as source code.
